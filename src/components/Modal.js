                  <p>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a timer face down, in front of them.</p>
                <p><strong>The Play</strong></p>
                <p>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.</p> 
                <p>If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up.</p>
                <p>The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards).</p>
                <p>If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up.</p>
                <p>The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.</p>
